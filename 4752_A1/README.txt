CS4752 Assignment 1 AStar

All aspects are now functional for the normal map file. For some unknown reason there is an index out of range error for the large file, maybe mixed up x and y indicies.
Final probnlem is in moving AStar into its own class, causes problems when attempting to use functions from Grid Class so no seperate AStar exists.
