CS4752 Assignment 4 solving sudoku with a genetic algorithm

Execute A4_main.py to set algorithm in motion and it will attempt to solve a sudoku puzzle. Unlikely to succed as it will get stuck in local
maximas frequently. Inside ga_student.py lines 44-47 can be edited to change several features of the algorithms performanced. Altering them 
can result in a better running attept but optimal settings are unknown to me. Also uncomment lines 135 and 173 to get a graph of how 
the algorithm is performing. Note this will hamper performance.
